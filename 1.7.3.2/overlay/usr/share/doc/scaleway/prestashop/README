If this is the first time you launch your prestashop image, you'll need to
configure it!

In order to do so, go to http://<your_ip> and use those credentials for your
database :
  - user : prestashop
  - password : <db_password>

After the installation is done, don't forget to delete the "install" folder!
  sudo rm -r /var/www/html/install/
